# Stock Price Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

This project demonstrates the use of Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict and forecast stock closing prices for the next 30 days.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data and normalizes stock price data.
- **Stacked LSTM Model**: Utilizes a multi-layer LSTM architecture to capture the temporal dependencies of stock prices.
- **300-Day Forecast**: Predicts stock closing prices for the next 300 days.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Results:
The model predicts the future stock prices with high accuracy, providing valuable insights into market trends.
